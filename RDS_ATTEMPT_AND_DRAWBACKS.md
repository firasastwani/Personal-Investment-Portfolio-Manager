# ðŸ›‘ Drawbacks & Lessons Learned

## Attempted AWS RDS Integration

**I attempted to migrate the backend database from a local MySQL instance to AWS RDS to provide a cloud-hosted, persistent, and employer-accessible data source.**
This would have allowed reviewers to experience the application with up-to-date, pre-populated stock data and without any local DB setup.

### Challenges Encountered

- **Cloud Latency & Throughput:**  
  AWS RDS introduces network latency and stricter resource limits compared to local MySQL. My applicationâ€™s price update logic, which performs many rapid, concurrent queries, worked well locally but overwhelmed the RDS instance, causing timeouts and connection failures.
- **Connection Pooling:**  
  The default HikariCP/JDBC connection pool settings were not tuned for cloud environments, leading to dropped or stalled connections under load.
- **Batch Processing:**  
  The price update orchestrator was designed for low-latency local DBs and did not batch or throttle queries, which is essential for cloud DBs.
- **Resource Constraints:**  
  Entry-level RDS instances (e.g., db.t2.micro) have limited CPU, memory, and max connections, which are quickly exhausted by high-frequency operations.
- **Complex Debugging:**  
  Diagnosing cloud DB issues is more complex due to the interplay of AWS networking, security groups, VPCs, and instance health.

### Result

- **After extensive debugging and optimization attempts, I determined that the current architecture and query patterns are not well-suited for a cloud-hosted RDS instance without significant refactoring (batching, async processing, or RDS upgrades).**
- **For the best demo experience, the project defaults to a local MySQL database.**  
  All features work reliably and responsively in this configuration.

### What I Learned

- Cloud DBs require careful connection management, batching, and async processing.
- Localhost development can mask performance and scaling issues that only appear in production-like environments.
- Itâ€™s important to document and communicate these lessons to future maintainers and reviewers.

## Other Project Drawbacks & Limitations

- **No Production-Grade Cloud Deployment:**  
  The project is not currently deployed on a public cloud or behind a managed load balancer.
- **No Automated CI/CD:**  
  Builds and deployments are manual; no GitHub Actions or similar pipeline is set up.
- **Limited Test Coverage:**  
  While core flows are tested, there is no comprehensive automated test suite.
- **No Horizontal Scaling:**  
  The backend is designed as a monolith and does not support horizontal scaling out-of-the-box.
- **Sensitive Data in Config:**  
  For demo purposes, some credentials are present in `application.yml`. In production, these should be managed via environment variables or a secrets manager.
- **Kafka/Redis Assumptions:**  
  The app assumes Kafka and Redis are running locally or in Docker Compose; cloud or remote brokers would require config changes.
